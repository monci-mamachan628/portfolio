🫁📷🧠 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images using Deep Learning
📝 Introduction
Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection that can cause mild to severe illness in people of all ages, especially in young children and the elderly. According to the World Health Organization, pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death globally.

Chest X-ray imaging is a common and effective diagnostic tool for pneumonia. However, manual interpretation of these images can be time-consuming, subjective, and heavily reliant on the availability of trained radiologists. This project aims to automate pneumonia detection from chest X-rays using deep learning techniques, thereby enhancing diagnostic efficiency and supporting healthcare professionals in making accurate and timely decisions.

🎯 Objective
To develop and implement a deep learning pipeline that accurately classifies chest X-ray images into "Normal" or "Pneumonia" categories, providing robust decision support to radiologists.

🧠 Deep Learning Pipeline
The pipeline consists of the following stages:

📥 Data Loading & Preprocessing
Input: Chest X-ray images (NORMAL & PNEUMONIA)

Operations: Resize, normalize, and augment images

Split: Train / Validation / Test

🏗️ Model Architecture
Models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) such as ResNet, VGG, or custom CNN

Transfer Learning: Pretrained models like ResNet50 or DenseNet121

⚙️ Training
Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

📊 Evaluation
Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC Curve

Classification Report

🔍 Inference
Predict pneumonia presence on new/unseen X-ray images

🧪 Dataset
This project utilizes the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset available on Kaggle.

Categories: NORMAL, PNEUMONIA

Total Images: ~5,000
